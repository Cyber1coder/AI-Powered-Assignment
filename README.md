# Portfolio Website

This is my personal portfolio website built using **HTML** and **CSS**.  
It includes sections like **Home**, **Skills**, and a newly added **Projects section** to showcase my work.

## Features
- Clean and professional UI  
- Responsive layout  
- Hover effects on skills and project cards  
- Simple and lightweight (HTML + CSS only)

I added the "Projects" section and the hovering effect on the project cards and the languages section.
I used *chatgpt* to build my the assignment website.
